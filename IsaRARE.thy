IsaRARE is a plugin for Isabelle that transforms rewrite rules in the RARE language into Isabelle
lemmas. It serves two main purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Verification:
 Proving a lemma generated by IsaRARE indicates that the corresponding rule is sound.

\item Reconstruction:
 If a rule is used in a proof certificate by an external solver, the generated lemmas can be used by
 the smt method during the reconstruction of that proof inside of Isabelle. 
\end{enumerate}

section \<open>Set-up and Quick Usage\<close>

text\<open>
IsaRARE itself does not require any prerequisites, but to execute the bit-vector examples in the
Tests/ folder a copy of Finite Machine Word Library from the Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP) is
needed \cite{WordLibAFP}. We have tested our tool with the version of the AFP from October 16, 2023.

IsaRARE can be used simply by importing IsaRARE.thy. To support Words use IsaRARE_Word. This is
merely a convenience solution since loading the Word library can take a while.

text\<open>
The two keywords the theory provides are used as follows:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item To parse a single RARE rule use:

@{command "parse_rare"} <input rare rule as string> 

Example usage:

@{command "parse_rare"} "(define-rule bool-eq-true ((t Bool)) (= t true) t)"\\

\item To parse a RARE file:

@{command "parse_rare_file"} <input rare file, theory imports, new theory name>

Example usage

@{command "parse_rare_file"} "/IsaRARE/Tests/example\_rewrites" "Parent\_Theory" "Example\_Rewrites"

\end{enumerate}

The command  @{command parse_rare} expects a rewrite as a single string. It can contain line

For @{command parse_rare_file} there are no restrictions on import theories or target theory. In
the future we might use the imported theories internally (to suggest proofs). However, right now
we don't and it is just useful if you reload RARE theories often (e.g., you have the proofs in a
different file and use our option such that they are always used, see \ref{sec:options}). 
In that case you want to add the name of that theory so when you reload the theory from the RARE
file all proofs automatically go though again.

Either set @{verbatim "IsaRARE_HOME"} or use absolute paths. Otherwise, IsaRARE will not be able
to find your files. While we can get the path IsaRARE is started from we cannot get where it is
saved at currently.

subsection \<open>Components\<close>

text\<open>
As explained in Section \ref{sec:functionality} there are discrepancies between some
SMT-LIB functions and their closest counterpart commonly used in some Isabelle library.
IsaRARE automatically adds assumption to lemmas if the Isabelle definition has to be restricted
because the SMT-LIB definition is undefined in some cases.

This information can make a lemma quite convoluted. The process can be turned off with the option
@{attribute "IsaRARE_implAssump"} = \textbf{true}|false>. This can be useful to get an overview.

WARNING: Turning this option off might create a lemma that is false or far harder to prove than the
rewrite! Especially for rules containing bit-vectors IsaRARE might not be able to infer types
correctly from gradual types. We recommend using the proof strategy Minimum instead to simplify
assumptions. 
\<close>

declare[[IsaRARE_implAssump = true]] (*Turn implicit assumption generation on or off (Warning this is an expert option: Lemmas might not be provable without the assumptions) *)

declare[[IsaRARE_listsAsVar = false]] (*When turned on list parameters are parsed as if they were variables (Warning this is an expert option: Lemmas might be proven but corresponding RARE rule is not correct) *)


subsection \<open>Proofs\<close>

text\<open>
IsaRARE can generate differently elaborate proofs. While many lemmas can be proven fully
automatically this might fail for others. 

Proof suggestions can be completely turned off by setting @{attribute IsaRARE_proofStrategy} to
"None". This means however that some lemmas will contain IsaRARE specific definitions.

If you decide to use the suggested proof sketch you have to understand the two dimensions at
play here:

1. Reliability. You might plan to re-run IsaRARE on your rewrite database frequently. Any rules that
have not changed since the last run should still have a valid proof without any manual interaction.
For you the option Reliable is the best. This option will produce a proof sketch that only 
removes any custom IsaRARE definition from the lemma. Then, it will call a second lemma with the
same name (e.g., rewrite_double_neg) as the current lemma but with a  \_lemma added
to its name (i.e., rewrite_double_neg_lemma).
You can now copy the proof state at that point and make such a lemma. Then, you prove it in another
theory file that you add to the @{command parse_rare_file} as a parent theory.

2. Automation. You want to get all the help you can get to prove a lemma. The option Full with some
of the theory specific options explained below will be the best option for you. Sometimes it will
be too eager and solve the goal before the proof has finished. You will have to manually clean up
the file in that case. Often however, no user provided proof might be necessary at all.

There is a bit of a trade-off between these two goals. In the first case you need to provide a
lemma for every lemma even if it could be automatically proven just to avoid the case of any proof
failing. In the second case whenever you re-run IsaRARE one of your proofs might break. Usually,
it is a good idea to use Full the first time you use IsaRARE on a database and then copy the proofs
and use Reliable for regression tests. 

The option Minimum tries to find a balance between both approaches; it applies some heuristics to
decide whether a helper lemma is necessary or not.

subsection \<open>Regression Tests\<close>

text \<open>
IsaRARE contains a number of regression tests with RARE rules from various theories that are used
by the SMT solver cvc5. They can be found in Tests/Regression/.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c | c | c }
 theory & rare file name & Isabelle theory name \\
 \hline
 EUF & euf\_rewrites & EUF\_Rewrites.thy \\
 Arithmetic & arith\_rewrites & Arith\_Rewrites.thy \\
 Sets & set\_rewrites & Set\_Rewrites.thy \\
 Arrays & array\_rewrites & Array\_Rewrites.thy \\
 Strings & string\_rewrites & String\_Rewrites.thy \\
 Bit-vectors & bv\_rewrites & Bitvector\_Rewrites.thy \\
             & bv\_rewrites\_proven & Bitvector\_Rewrites\_Proven.thy
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For all theories except bit-vectors we were able to prove all lemmas corresponding to their rewrite
rules. For bit-vectors we therefore include two files; One with all the rewrite rules cvc5 uses
(bv\_rewrites) and one with the subset of these that we can prove (bv\_rewrites\_proven). The
corresponding Isabelle/HOL theories that contain the lemmas that IsaRARE generated are in the same
directory.

To run IsaRARE on all RARE files in Tests/ on the command line:

  isabelle build -d <path\_to\_afp>/thys/ -d. IsaRARE-Tests

To build the resulting theories (check that the proofs we provide work) run:

  isabelle build -d <path\_to\_afp>/thys/ -d. IsaRARE-Results

This checks all files except the bit-vector rewrites that we have not proven yet.

To use the graphical user interface open Tests/IsaRARE\_Tests.thy.
